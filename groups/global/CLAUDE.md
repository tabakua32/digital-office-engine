# Global Agent Context

## Shared Rules (apply to ALL departments)
1. Read your department CLAUDE.md at session start
2. Check workspace/pipeline-state.md for interrupted work
3. Use skills from _index.md — never improvise without checking
4. Write diary entry before session ends
5. Output goes to output/{YYYY-MM-DD}/ with descriptive filenames

- Shared DB: shared/data/office.db (via SQLite MCP)
